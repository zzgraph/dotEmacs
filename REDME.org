* What is in this repo
my personal emacs configuration files and settings.
* The structure of configuration files
all settings are nested in a folder called misc and named based on
context, those files are getting called by init.el, it might be
changed in future and I migrate to use org-babel and store all the
settings in a single org file, but for now every package specific
setting stays on a single file conventionally named =packageInit.el=
* TODO?
see the [[./TODO.org][TODO File]]
