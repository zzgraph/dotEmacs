#+CREATOR: Emacs 25.2.1 (Org mode 9.0.9)

* Features which should be implemented

** TODO Adding Electric pair for #, * and _ to Markdown-mode
** TODO Adding pandoc minor mode to Markdown-mode
** TODO Find a way to write blog post in a single large org-file and export each heding as a separate blog post.

* changes and tests need to be done immediately

** TODO Diminish mode seems to be unable to remove many minor modes, I should find a solution or determine where I did it wrong.
** TODO I always forget to quit gnus before closing Emacs frame

   Here is some functions from to let it do the thing, but I don't
   know if it works with Emacs daemon ([[http://git.hacks-galore.org/gitweb/jao?p=emacs.git;a=blob;f=custom/jao-gnus.el;h=8f83a8fa4920356098e0f2a7f5c8371db916d71b;hb=HEAD][Jao Gnus Configuration]])

** TODO BBDB always starts to check file when I need it right away

   find a way to start it before message mode starts. Also it still
   need to sync with google contacts automatically instead of using
   downloaded dump.

** TODO Is There anyway to determine from header in message mode based on recipient?

   in gnus I can automatically use posting-styles to use particular
   email address when replying to an article, but what if I ran
   message mode by hitting `C-x m' outside of gnus?

   I should writ a function to ask me before sending which email I
   want to use, or if the email address is in a known list of email,
   use a particular address to answer.

** TODO Test notmuch search backend for GNUS
** TODO If Projectile project name=nil diminish projectile from mode-line


* Some more ambitious tasks

** TODO MAYBE Rewrite all code base of org-babel and use-package macro
** TODO FUN Rewrite installer instead of bash script use elisp getting evaluated by emacs.


* Known Issues



* Done
** DONE Disability to use ssh public key to connect remotes and push to github is now resolved, Using `exec-path-from-shell' and copy copying this great code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (memq window-system '(nac ns x)) (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))

(exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "SSH_AGENT_PID")
(exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "SSH_AUTH_SOCK")
#+end_src
