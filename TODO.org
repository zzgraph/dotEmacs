   Here is some functions from to let it do the thing, but I don't

** TODO BBDB always starts to check file when I need it right away

   find a way to start it before message mode starts. Also it still
   need to sync with google contacts automatically instead of using
   downloaded dump.

** TODO Is There anyway to determine from header in message mode based on recipient?

   in gnus I can automatically use posting-styles to use particular
   email address when replying to an article, but what if I ran
   message mode by hitting `C-x m' outside of gnus?

   I should writ a function to ask me before sending which email I
   want to use, or if the email address is in a known list of email,
   use a particular address to answer.

   theme, the color may override transparency settings in terminal
   emulator.
