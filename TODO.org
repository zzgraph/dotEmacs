** TODO I always forget to quit gnus before closing Emacs frame

   Here is some functions from to let it do the thing, but I don't
   know if it works with Emacs daemon ([[http://git.hacks-galore.org/gitweb/jao?p=emacs.git;a=blob;f=custom/jao-gnus.el;h=8f83a8fa4920356098e0f2a7f5c8371db916d71b;hb=HEAD][Jao Gnus Configuration]])

** TODO BBDB always starts to check file when I need it right away

   find a way to start it before message mode starts. Also it still
   need to sync with google contacts automatically instead of using
   downloaded dump.

** TODO Is There anyway to determine from header in message mode based on recipient?

   in gnus I can automatically use posting-styles to use particular
   email address when replying to an article, but what if I ran
   message mode by hitting `C-x m' outside of gnus?

   I should writ a function to ask me before sending which email I
   want to use, or if the email address is in a known list of email,
   use a particular address to answer.

** TODO Test notmuch search backend for GNUS
** TODO If Projectile project name=nil diminish projectile from mode-line

** TODO MAYBE Rewrite all code base of org-babel and use-package macro
** TODO FUN Rewrite installer instead of bash script use elisp getting evaluated by emacs.
